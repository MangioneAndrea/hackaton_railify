1. Read PDF as Bitmap
Description: Load the PDF file and convert each page into a high-resolution bitmap image to facilitate analysis.
2. Analyze Bitmap for Elements
Description: Utilize image processing techniques to analyze the bitmap. Implement algorithms to identify lines, shapes, and symbols (e.g., rectangles, circles, lines).
Output: Store identified elements in a structured data format, including their coordinates, types e.g.
3. Connect Pixels to Identified Elements
Description: Map pixels within the bitmap to their corresponding elements based on proximity and shape recognition algorithms.
Output: Create a comprehensive data structure that links pixel data to their respective geometric entities (e.g., line, shapes).
4. Display Results
Description: Visualize the identified elements in a user-friendly interface.
5. Export to SVG
Description: Generate an SVG file from the processed data structure. Mark any missing parts or unrecognized elements within the SVG, perhaps using a different color or shape.
